The big data wave washed me out of the academic world of Nuclear Physics a few years back when my love of mathematics and passion for high performance computing saw an opportunity in the field of (Big) Data Science.

I've done research into exotic nuclei at CERN, burned through a few SAP go-lives, built a state-of-the-art Big Data Platform, and trained predictive models at scale. Perhaps the most difficult so far, I've started a data science programme and built a data science team.

In a nutshell, I do it for the passion: I like maths, patterns, seeing code light CPUs up, wine and surfing.

[My wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanya-bouma-6653158b/) (Civil Engineer with design and project management training) and I are looking for the next adventure in Western Europe or Scandinavia, so don't hesitate to get in touch!
